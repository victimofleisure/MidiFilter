# MidiFilter

I use this app to process my own MIDI files, applying effects that aren't supported in my [Polymeter MIDI Sequencer](https://victimofleisure.github.io/Polymeter/). All effects are applied in event space and most of them only affect notes.

The effects include:
* quantizing
* tying adjacent notes
* making notes legato
* scaling note durations
* merging one or more channels
* offsetting times to create groove
* analyzing pitch class sets

The code compiles cleanly in Visual Studio 2012 and probably later versions too. The project is currently a bit messy and contains hard-coded paths.
