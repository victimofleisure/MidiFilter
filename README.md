# MidiFilter

I use this app to process my own MIDI files, applying effects that aren't supported in my Polymeter sequencer. All effects are applied in event space and most of them only affect notes. The project is currently a bit messy and contains hard-coded paths.

The code compiles cleanly in Visual Studio 2012 and probably later versions too.
